🌟 <h1>Introduction</h1>
The existence of shells is deeply connected to the history of computing itself. Back in the early days, developers communicated with computers using 1/0 switches, which was tedious and frustrating.

To simplify this interaction, shells were created: programs that interpret commands entered by users, enabling them to perform tasks in a more human-readable way.

With Minishell, you'll travel back in time and explore the challenges faced by developers before graphical interfaces (like Windows) existed. It's a hands-on experience with the foundations of modern computing.

🧰 <h1>Description</h1>
Minishell is a command-line interface (CLI) inspired by popular shells like Bash, Zsh, and Fish.

Here’s what you’ll learn by building or using it:

How a terminal works 🖥️
How commands are executed 🏗️
Environment variables and PATH 🗺️
Redirections and pipes 🔄
System-level programming concepts ⚙️
While this is a simplified version of a shell, it covers the essential features and mechanics, giving you a deeper understanding of Unix systems.
